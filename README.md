# Classifying News, Satire, and "Fake News": An SVM and Deep Learning Approach
Senior Thesis completed as part of coursework for Princeton University.

This repository contains the final report, some of the code, and data used in my senior thesis titled *Classifying News, Satire, and "Fake News": An SVM and Deep Learning Approach*.

The code is requires several libraries, chiefly pandas, scikit-learn, and keras. Changing some file locations may be necessary to run directly as these programs were set up to run on Princeton's Nobel and Adroit clusters.

Raw data files and code for processing them is omitted. Included instead is allData.zip, which contains allSatire.csv and allSerious.csv. These files contain all satirical and all serious news articles used as data for this project. Also included are train.csv and test.csv which were used for training and testing satire against serious news in the project. Note that these are two divisions of the same data.
