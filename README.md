# Thesis
Senior Thesis completed as part of coursework for Princeton University.

This repository contains the final report, code, and data used in my senior thesis titled *Analyzing the Changing Relationship Between News, Satire, and "Fake News": An SVM and Deep Learning Approach*.

The code is requires several libraries, chiefly pandas, scikit-learn, and keras. Changing some file locations may be necessary to run directly as these programs were set up to run on Princeton's Nobel cluster.

Raw data files and code for processing them is omitted. Included instead is allData.zip, which contains allSatire.csv and allSerious.csv. These files contain all satirical and all serious news articles used as data for this project.

# Under Construction
New files will be added as they become available. The final report will be uploaded in April.
