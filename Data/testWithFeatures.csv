0,"I'm on the corner of Main Street, just tryin' to keep it in line. You say you wanna move on and you say I'm falling behind, can you read my mind? Can you read my mind? I never really gave up on breakin' out of this two-star town. I got the green light, I got a little fight, I'm gonna turn this thing around. Can you read my mind? Can you read my mind? The good old days, the honest man. The restless heart, the promised land. The subtle kiss that no-one sees, the broken wrist and the big trapeze. Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind, 'cause I don't shine if you don't shine. Before you go, can you read my mind? It's funny how you just break down, waiting on some sign. I pull up to the front of your driveway with magic soaking my spine. Can you read my mind? Can you read my mind? The teenage queen, the loaded gun. The drop dead dream the chose one. A southern drawl, a world unseen, a city wall, and a trampoline. Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind, 'cause I don't shine if you don't shine. Before you jump, tell me what you find when you read my mind. Slipping in my faith until I fall, you never returned that call. Woman, open the door, don't let it sting. I wanna breathe that fire again. She said 'I don't mind if you don't mind, 'cause I don't shine if you don't shine' Put your back on me, put your back on me. Oh, put your back on me.

1,"Religious iconography giving you the creeps? I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek. The rise of the machines. I must admit you gave me something momentarily in which I could believe. But the hand of harsh reality's ungloved and it's on its way back here to scoop you up. But not on my watch. I want to stay with you my love, the way some science fiction does. Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies. Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity, the ascension of the CREAM. Mass panic on a not-too-distant future colony, quantitative easing. I want to make a simple point about peace and love, but in a sexy way where it's not obvious. Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages, the way some science fiction does. The way some science fiction does. Got the world on a wire, in my little mirror, mirror on the wall, in the pocket of my raincoat. So I tried to write a song to make you blush, but I've a feeling that the whole thing may well just end up too clever for its own good, the way some science fiction does.",2018,Science Fiction,Arctic Monkeys,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,225,1.1377777777777778,2.0,15,0,0,35.61,83.56,42.800000000000004,12.954285714285716,12.5,5.8

Now to unsee what I've seen, to undo what has been done, turn off all the lights and let the morning come, come. Now there's a green light in my eyes and my lover on my mind. And I sing from the piano, tear my yellow dress and cry and cry and cry over the love of you. All this champagne-drunken home, against the current of gold. Everybody see I love him. 'Cause it's a feeling that you get when the afternnon is set on the bridge into the city. And now to unsee what I've seen, to undo what has been done, turn off all the lights, let the morning come.

Fell out of bed, butterfly bandage, but don't worry. You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry. Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man, he needs his head put through a CAT scan. Hey editor, I'm undeniable, hey doctor, I'm certifiable. Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine. What a match, I'm half-doomed and you're semi-sweet. So boycott love, detox just to retox. And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life. Perfect boys with their perfect lives, nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy. Oh, little girl, you got me staring odd. Or was that just a telescopic camera nod?

But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore, no, we cannot cling to those dreams. Does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body? I don't know...
