Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts with the efficiency that only youth can harness. And do you still think that love is a laserquest? Or do you take it all more seriously? I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had but you're always busy being make-believe. And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there, or has somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered? When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover. Now I can't think of there without thinking of you. I doubt that comes as a surprise. And I can't think of anything to dream about, I can't find anywhere to hide. When I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes and I've convinced myself I need another for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover. When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair singing dreadful songs about summat I have found a better method of pretending you were just some lover. Well, I have found a better method of pretending you were just some lover.",2011,"Love Is A Laserquest"

Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick and it's all in my head but she's touching his chest now, she takes off her dress now. Let me go. And I just can't look, it's killing me and taking control. Jealousy, turning saints into the sea, swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibies, but it's just the price I pay. Destiny is calling me, open up my eager eyes 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside. I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine. Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all.
